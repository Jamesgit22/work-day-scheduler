# Work Day Scheduler
A webapp to help keep track of your workday agenda.

## User Guide:

This tool displays common working hours from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and allows you to add any important reminders or to-do list items to a specific hour. If you want to store a task that will be repeated every day at the same time, you can click the blue save button on the right-hand side of the hour block you have entered your note in. This will save your note to local storage so that you can come back anytime to see your note. If you need to clear a note that you have saved, you can delete the text in the text area and click the save button again. You will also find that the current date is displayed at the top of the screen, and the hours section is color coded. If the hour has a color of gray, than it is a past hour in the day. The red hour block denotes the current hour. Green hour blocks are future hours in the day.
